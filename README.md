# LittleEchoes

***Find the Machine, discover its Echoes***

## Mechanics

- Purchase The Machine from the Hub Area via the Merchant, for 20 void essence
- At The Machine, Craft two or more Waypoint Runes with rubble and flower petals. Each color will symbolize a different profession for your Echo.(currently implemented: red {guard} & yellow {wanderer})
- Craft an Echo's core with 1 colored Waypoint Rune + 100 essence
- Place one or more Waypoint Runestones on the ground for your Echo to path to
- Spawn your new companions!


Echoes target and path to navigational Runes that are placed in the local area; with one rune in range, they idle in place until something triggers them to react. 
Perfect for guard posts! If more runes are detected nearby, they wander randomly between runes.

Guard Echoes (red) will look for the nearest hostile mob to fight. They cast an Area of Effect to damage enemies, pummeling their bodies with invisible sonic vibrations. Currently, Skeletons and Zombies are the only recognized targets.

Wanderer Echoes (yellow) will simply wander randomly between nodes, providing a sense of liveliness to the area!
